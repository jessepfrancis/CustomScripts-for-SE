# CustomScripts-for-SE
Collection of custom SE Scripts

This is a set of UserScripts I use to make maths.SE distraction free by removing unwanted window components.

## HideAllSE-Mainpage.user.js

This GreaseMonkey script hides:
* Everything else than notifications and search from topbar
* Sidebar from Mainpage/questions page
* User Profile links incliding Badges from Top Menu.
* Footer

Aim is to provide a distraction free mainpage/questions page, where there's only new questions and notifications to bother you.

## HideAllSE-QS.user.js
* Everything else than notifications and search from topbar
* Many components of sidebad are hidden; including Blog/Meta box, Hot Network Questions Box, feed link etc
* Footer is hidden
* User Profile links incliding Badges from Top Menu.

I started off by tweaking scripts by @NormalHuman.
